# Interactive CV Dashboard with ChatGPT Integration

## Overview

Welcome to the Interactive CV Dashboard project, a unique approach to presenting Paolo's professional journey. By integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT, users can dive deep into Paolo's expertise and experiences in an engaging Q&A format.

Whether you're curious about his proficiency with Python, SQL, dbt, Tableau/PowerBI, Apache Airflow, or any other part of his professional path, just ask away! This platform is designed to give you a dynamic insight into his professional world.

## Purpose

In an ever-evolving digital age, static CVs can sometimes lack the flair and interactivity to truly showcase one's capabilities. This project aims to:

- **Innovate the job application process:** Break away from traditional CV formats and embrace a more interactive and engaging user experience.
  
- **Provide Instantaneous Answers:** Rather than skimming through lines of text, users can directly ask specific questions about Paolo's expertise, experiences, or any particular interest.
  
- **Blend Technology with Professionalism:** Showcase Paolo's technical prowess by seamlessly integrating with one of the most advanced conversational AI platforms.
