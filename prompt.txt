After completing their Bachelor's degree,  Paolo decided to pursue a Master of Science in Business Analytics from the 
Technical University of Denmark (DTU). During their studies, they gained expertise in various areas such as data analytics, 
management, machine learning, and optimization. They developed skills in reporting with PowerBI, data processing with pandas, 
data visualization, data mining, and text analysis. Additionally, they gained experience in stakeholder management,
